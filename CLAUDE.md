# CLAUDE.md - Instructions for Claude Code

You are working on **HotMic**, a Windows audio routing application. Keep responses concise and implementation-focused.

## Primary References

- `AGENTS.md` for architecture rules, threading constraints, workflow, testing policy, and WSL limitations.
- `docs/technical/README.md` for DSP/analysis/visualization specs and code-reference format.
- `README.md` for product scope and user-facing requirements.

## Spec Hygiene

Do not duplicate spec content here. When behavior changes, update the relevant doc under `docs/technical/` and keep its code references accurate.
